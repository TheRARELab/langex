## Demo
 - Instructions for the demo of the code.
   - Open the project in the [`generalized-experiment`](generalized-experiment) folder by clicking on `generalized-experiment.pml`
   - Open the dialog panel from the View menu.
   - Run the project based on the instructions for running the [hello-world project](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/getting_started/helloworld_choregraphe.html).
     - First run the behavior in the `initialize_post` folder
     - Then run the behavior in the `experiment_behavior` folder
   - As you run the program, type `next` or `n` in the dialog panel to make the robot speak the next utterance
 - Expected output.
   - The robot should behave and speak exactly the same as this video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5plLXZN3D0E
