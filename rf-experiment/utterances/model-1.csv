"Look somewhere in a different quadrant for one of these yellow cuboids that's slightly longer."
"And we need a second one of long green triangles to start with."
"Alright, so flip it over with its largest face facing down."
"Then take that long green triangle."
"And put it with like the top of along with this edge."
"Take this blue arch."
"And put it to the right of that. Stick there."
"And then do the same thing, this red arch, just on the other side."
"Now this short red thin cuboid. Put on the, like this furthest, on the top."
"And then do the same things sequentially with the long yellow thin cuboid,"
"and this short yellow thin cuboid."
"And then maybe bring in a blue arch."
"Just put it up now."
"that red arch, take the red arch"
"And then put it upside down on top of the blue arch."
"Okay. Push it over. So it kind of goes onto the green long triangle a little bit."
"And then kind of create the circle with the blue one."
"Are there... like… thick versions of… Can you see if there are longer versions of these yellow cubes, they're blue and yellow."
"Put the yellow thick cuboid down on its side, right next to the red arch."
"And the blue thick cuboid on top of that."
"And then the small blue triangle. Just push half of it on, along that edge. So it should be, point up."
"Take the two green cylinders. Put them on top of the rectangle ones."
"Do you need a red cylinder?"
"So it next to the green cylinders."
"And then the yellow cylinder to the red."
"And then that green thick cuboid over there, on top of the middle two cylinders."
"And then one of these, like the blue, half circles"
" like a hat on top of the yellow cylinder that sticks up."
