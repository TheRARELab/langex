"Okay. We're going to need a second green cube and a second yellow cube"
"And then also a blue thick cuboid. The same thickness."
"Start with a blue thick cuboid right there."
"Then a green cube next to it to the right."
"And a yellow cube next to that."
"And then, a red thick cuboidâ€¦ a red thick cuboid... On top of the blue."
"And then a green cube on top of a green cube."
"And a yellow cube on top of the yellow."
"And then on the right of these, stack a thin long green cuboid vertically."
"Try to find a green arch."
"And on top of a red thick cuboid, make the circle."
"I need a yellow thick cuboid, like one of these types of prism."
"And put a yellow thick cuboid "
" to the right of the, a arches."
"And then one of a red cube, "
" I think that size to the right of a yellow thick cuboid."
"And find a yellow thick cuboid that looks the same as the red prism."
"So, a small red triangle"
" a small green triangle"
"And find a second a small red triangle, and a small blue triangle, one of the triangles"
"On top of them, from left to right, it's going to be a small red triangle,"
" a small blue triangle,"
" and a small green triangle."
"And on a small red triangle a long green thin cuboid."
"And the final thing is to put a blue cylinder inside of the circle."
