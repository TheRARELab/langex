"Look somewhere in a different quadrant for one of these yellow cuboids that's slightly longer."
"And we need it to start with."
"Alright, so flip a long green triangle over with its largest face facing down."
"Then take the long green triangle."
"And put this long green triangle with like the top of along with this edge."
"Take that."
"And put this blue arch to the right of that. Stick there."
"And then do the same thing, it, just on the other side."
"Now that. Put on the, like this furthest, on the top."
"And then do the same things sequentially with this long yellow thin cuboid,"
"and that."
"And then maybe bring in the blue arch."
"Just put it up now."
"that red arch, take a red arch"
"And then put that red arch upside down on top of the blue arch."
"Okay. Push this over. So it kind of goes onto that green long triangle a little bit."
"And then kind of create the circle with the blue one."
"Are there... like… thick versions of… Can you see if there are longer versions of these yellow cubes, they're blue and yellow."
"Put a yellow thick cuboid down on its side, right next to the red arch."
"And a blue thick cuboid on top of that."
"And then the small blue triangle. Just push half of a small blue triangle on, along that edge. So this should be, point up."
"Take the two green cylinders. Put them on top of the rectangle ones."
"Do you need that?"
"So that next to this green cylinders."
"And then this yellow cylinder to the red."
"And then this over there, on top of the middle two cylinders."
"And then one of these, like the blue, half circles"
" like a hat on top of this yellow cylinder that sticks up."
