"Okay. We're going to need a second green cube and a second yellow cube"
"And then also a blue thick cuboid. The same thickness."
"Start with the blue thick cuboid right there."
"Then the green cube next to it to the right."
"And the yellow cube next to that."
"And then, that red thick cuboidâ€¦ the red thick cuboid... On top of the blue."
"And then the green cube on top of the green cube."
"And the yellow cube on top of the yellow."
"And then on the right of these, stack a thin long green cuboid vertically."
"Try to find a green arch."
"And on top of the red thick cuboid, make the circle."
"I need a yellow thick cuboid, like one of these types of prism."
"And put it "
" to the right of the, the arches."
"And then one of that red cube, "
" I think that size to the right of the yellow thick cuboid."
"And find a yellow thick cuboid that looks the same as the red prism."
"So, this small red triangle"
" this small green triangle"
"And find a second a small red triangle, and a small blue triangle, one of the triangles"
"On top of them, from left to right, it's going to be the small red triangle,"
" it,"
" and the small green triangle."
"And on the small red triangle the long green thin cuboid."
"And the final thing is to put the blue cylinder inside of the circle."
