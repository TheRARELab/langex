"Okay. We're going to need a second green cube and this second yellow cube"
"And then also this. The same thickness."
"Start with this blue thick cuboid right there."
"Then a green cube next to it to the right."
"And it next to that."
"And then, this red thick cuboidâ€¦ the red thick cuboid... On top of the blue."
"And then the green cube on top of that."
"And the yellow cube on top of the yellow."
"And then on the right of these, stack a thin long green cuboid vertically."
"Try to find a green arch."
"And on top of this red thick cuboid, make the circle."
"I need it, like one of these types of prism."
"And put that yellow thick cuboid "
" to the right of the, the arches."
"And then one of the red cube, "
" I think that size to the right of that."
"And find a yellow thick cuboid that looks the same as the red prism."
"So, that small red triangle"
" the small green triangle"
"And find a second that, and it, one of the triangles"
"On top of them, from left to right, it's going to be the small red triangle,"
" it,"
" and that small green triangle."
"And on it the long green thin cuboid."
"And the final thing is to put that blue cylinder inside of the circle."
