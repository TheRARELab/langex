"Look somewhere in a different quadrant for one of these yellow cuboids that's slightly longer."
"And we need a second one of long green triangles to start with."
"Alright, so flip a long green triangle over with its largest face facing down."
"Then take a long green triangle."
"And put a long green triangle with like the top of along with this edge."
"Take a blue arch."
"And put a blue arch to the right of that. Stick there."
"And then do the same thing, a red arch, just on the other side."
"Now a short red thin cuboid. Put on the, like this furthest, on the top."
"And then do the same things sequentially with a long yellow thin cuboid,"
"and a short yellow thin cuboid."
"And then maybe bring in a blue arch."
"Just put a blue arch up now."
"a red arch, take a red arch"
"And then put a red arch upside down on top of the blue arch."
"Okay. Push a red arch over. So a red arch kind of goes onto a green long triangle a little bit."
"And then kind of create the circle with the blue one."
"Are there... like… thick versions of… Can you see if there are longer versions of these yellow cubes, they're blue and yellow."
"Put a yellow thick cuboid down on its side, right next to a red arch."
"And a blue thick cuboid on top of that."
"And then a small blue triangle. Just push half of a small blue triangle on, along that edge. So a small blue triangle should be, point up."
"Take the two green cylinders. Put them on top of the rectangle ones."
"Do you need a red cylinder?"
"So a red cylinder next to a green cylinders."
"And then a yellow cylinder to the red."
"And then a green thick cuboid over there, on top of the middle two cylinders."
"And then one of these, like the blue, half circles"
" like a hat on top of a yellow cylinder that sticks up."
